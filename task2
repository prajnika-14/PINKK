TASK-2
Problem 3: Is there a relationship between the daily minimum and maximum temperature? Can you predict the maximum temperature given the minimum temperature?
To create the flowchart, we used the Graphviz library to visualize the workflow of our temperature analysis process.
•	Nodes: Represented each key step in the process (e.g., loading data, cleaning data, visualization, regression modeling, and prediction).
•	Edges: Connected the steps in logical order to show the flow of actions.
•	Regression Equation: Included the linear equation from the model as part of the flow.
•	Output: Rendered the flowchart as a PNG image for use in the presentation.
This flowchart visually summarizes the entire analytical process from data input to prediction.
