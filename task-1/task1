Identifying Good Problems for ML
We can identify applications for Machine Learning by looking for ideal traits like:
•	Large size, high quality datasets are available.
•	Clear objectives exist (e.g., predicting, classifying, or clustering).
•	Data patterns or correlations can be extracted from the given data.

Hard ML Problems
•	Datasets may have less or incorrect data.
•	Can degrade model performance.
•	Ethical concerns such as privacy issues or bias in data.
•	Ensuring models perform well on unseen, real-world data beyond training datasets.
